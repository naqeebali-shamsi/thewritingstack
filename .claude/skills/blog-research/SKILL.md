<workflow_steps>
1. **Identify Gaps**: Analyze the current article spec to see what technical details or metrics are missing.
2. **Search Strategy**: 
    - Search for Reddit/HN/Twitter discussions (Observer voice source).
    - Search for official docs or GitHub issues for technical edge cases.
3. **Synthesize**: extract:
    - 3-5 specific technical facts.
    - 1-2 real-world "failure modes" related to the topic.
    - Any relevant performance benchmarks.
4. **Update Spec**: Append the findings to the article spec file under a `<research_data>` tag.
</workflow_steps>

<constraints>
- Use `browser_subagent` for complex technical documentation.
- Maintain the "Expert Pragmatist" lens—look for practical "gotchas," not just theory.
